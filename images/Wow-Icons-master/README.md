Wow-Icons
=========

This repository is a collection of various World of Warcraft icons that I've made use of over the years. I find it hard to locate complete sets of icons available for download, so I thought I'd share my icon compilations in case you need them for your next project. I'll add any new icons I find/make to this repo.

**Enjoy!**

Here's what you'll find in the repo:


### `images/boss/`
This diectory contains PNGs of various boss models on a transparent background. I constructed them through a very convoluted process involving a model viewer, so if you enjoy using them plese give me a shout out and maybe I'll make more in the future.

### `images/class/`
Class icons, in both **18x18** and **64x64**. Some of the images are inconsistent (e.g. black background or slightly different borders), but that's mainly due to the scattered nature of the icon sources.

### `images/spec/`
Class specialization icons, organied into directories by class. All icons are **64x64**i

### `images/crests`
Class crests in PNG format. Images are **320x320**.
